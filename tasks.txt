hey there
add a task with "add <task_name>"
and then try removing some with remove "remove <task_number>"
you can also create a section to better organise your tasks and group them based on relevance with "<section_name> add <task_name>"
if the section doesn't exist it is automatically created
remove a section after confirming with "remove <section_name>"
refer "help" for more info
